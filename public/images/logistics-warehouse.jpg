I cannot directly create or generate a JPG image file through text output. JPG files are binary image files, not text files that can be written with text content.

Instead, I recommend either:

1. Using a placeholder image service like `https://placehold.co/600x400?text=Logistics+Warehouse` in your code
2. Downloading a free stock image of a logistics warehouse from sites like Unsplash or Pexels
3. Creating a simple SVG placeholder that can be used instead

Would you like me to provide a solution using one of these approaches instead?
